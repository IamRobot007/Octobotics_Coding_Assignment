To start this file or code 

    1. 1st open terminal and type “roscore”
    2. next open another terminal and type 
    3. “roslaunch inverted_pendulum_sim inverted_pendulum_sim.launch”
    4. Then a window will pop-up which will show u the 1st goal as per given in PDF as mention
    5. given as cart mass = 0.5, pendulum mass = 2kg and length = 300 unit.
       
    6. Now for Goal 2 
    7. follow same step till step 3
    8. and open terminal and type 
    9. “rosrun inverted_pendulum_sim inverted_pendulum_goal2.py”
    10. which will open a another window and 1st show the graph of velocity, acceleration
    11. And then close that window
    12. now on the 1st window u will see goal 2 will be performing

    13. Now for Goal 3
    14. follow same step till step 3
    15. and open terminal and type 
    16. “rosrun inverted_pendulum_sim inverted_pendulum_goal3.py”
    17. In this u will see thet pendulum will be balance by itself.
